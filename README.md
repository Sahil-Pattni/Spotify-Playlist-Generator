# Spotify Playlist Generator
### Status: `In Development`

## Description
I have an Alexa routine that plays a playlist of mine on Spotify every morning, to wake me up.
The problem is - after a few days - I get too accustomed to the songs and can easily sleep right
through them.

This program will generate a playlist of songs designed to wake you up, based on Spotify's track analytics.
You may optionally provide a `limit_ms` parameter to generate a playlist of songs as close to 
`limit_ms` as possible.
